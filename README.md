## My Process


### Built With

- React.js
- CSS3

### How It Works

Upon pressing the "Start quiz" button, a request for trivia data from the Open Trivia DB is made via the fetch method. 
The "quiz page" is then rendered and five questions with multiple choice answers are populated. Users must answer all five questions and 
then check if they got the answers correct by hitting the "Check answers" button. Once the aforementioned button is clicked, the "Play again" button along
with text displaying the number of correct answers the user selected is rendered. If the "Play again" button is clicked, then the "home page" is rendered again.



### What I Learned

- How to create reusable components
- Continued practice of using props
- Passing state as a prop
- How to create a unique ID via nanoid
- Further practice using React hooks (useState & useEffect)
- Naming convention for component folders and files
- Conditional rendering using && and ternary operator
